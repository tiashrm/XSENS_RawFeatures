### Study Design

- **Exosuit Use:**
- Participants wore the Herowear Apex Back Assist exosuit.
- **Objective:** 
- 1) Effects of using a passive low back soft exoskeleton during varied lifting tasks
  2) Effects of using the LBE for emergency medical service
  3) Assessing perception and potential adoption of LBE for EMT use 
  
- **Participants**: 21 EMTs volunteered for the study
- **Investigation Methods**:
  - Heart rate monitoring
  - Motion kinematics analysis
  - Electromyography (EMG)
  - Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire
  - Exoskeleton User Intent questionnaire
  - Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE)
  - Ratings of mental demand
  - NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX) questionnaire
- **Tasks**:
  - **Lifting Task**:
    - Description: Participants performed varied repetitive lifting with a 9.8 kg cardiac monitor
